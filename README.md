THE COURSE
• MEAN Stack is very simple compared to other frameworks, and very easy to get up and running. MEAN stack is easy to understand, data flow is clear, and it’s very fast.
• MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.
• There are not many video courses that I am aware of that show how to do a production-grade application with MEAN with common libraries to make life easier. The focus on functional programming concepts. MEAN is composed of of MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs, and Node.js. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
• The Four most important things the viewer will learn by the end of the video course will be:
• Managing deep/complex data with MongoDB
• Backend system development with Node-Js and its APIs in express-Js
• The front end responsive system UI with Angular-JS
• The asynchronous commination between the server and the client by the use of Node-Js
  
THE AUDIENCE
• This course is for Basic JavaScript developers who want to create highly scalable, enterprise-grade apps.
• Basic knowledge of Angular-Js is necessary; how ever you do not need detailed knowledge of the other stack
components such as Node.JS, Express, MongoDB.
• Basic knowledge of web application architecture.
• Experience working with SQL or NoSQL databases
• Scalable, secure, cloud based system enthusiast.


THE AUTHOR
I am a hardworking young Entrepreneur, working to on-board the latest technology to my community where technology is next to a myth. I learn new things every single day and put them to practice with marvelous product at the end of the day that solve our community problems.
I have show cased the turning of problematic Ideas to sustainable business while moving beyond limitations and exceptionally design around a problem in a new way instead of around constraints internally.
I have demonstrated success in leading and developing complex multiple high profile projects simultaneously, not forgetting extensively partnering with both local and global companies as well as groups, in achieving tremendously scalable products with proven track record in delivering business change and advantage while adding value.
I do this with exceptionally confidence in communicating at all levels right from complex technicality to simplicity using comprehensible communication skills as a key enabler. I am founder of creativeDNA a information technology company majoring in media and health.

WHAT WILL YOU LEARN
• Learn how to use GIT, and NODE.
• Be able to create a MongoDB Schema and use it.
• Make a backend system that interoperates with the MongoDB as well as the Angular JS UI.
• Explore the creation of REST APIs with express Js for the back end system to communicate with the front end system.
• Build a responsive Front end system for the UI that communicates with the backend through Express JS REST APIs.
• Design a Socket IO for asynchronous communication between the Frontend and the Backend server.
• Deploy and maintain the application successfully on Google cloud platform.


COURSE OUTLINE

VOLUME ONE – Setting up your first application Data Layout.

This Volume walks the viewer through how to set up the absolute foundations of a modern MEAN Stack application. Testing is an important part of any real-world application. This volume introduces how to use the mocha testing framework to do behavior driven design on a MEAN stack application.
By the end of this volume, they will have a website that loads in the browser, and shows the current time live.

SECTION ONE - Setting Up Application Layout Estimated Length: 19 minutes

This section walks the viewer through how to set up the absolute foundations of a modern MEAN application. By the end of this section, they will have a website that loads in the browser, and shows the current time live.


SECTION TWO -: Mocking Everything: BDD Tests with Mocha and MongoDB
Estimated Length: 15 minutes

Testing is an important part of any real-world application. This section introduces how to use the Mocha testing framework to do behavior driven design on a MEAN application.


VOLUME TWO – MONGODB SCHEMA DESIGN

The bread and butter of a MEAN database: we are going to understand how to use MongoDB using the JavaScript drivers, creating models and the like. A discussion of what functional programming principles with mongoose are, why they are beneficial, and how they’re not relegated to “functional languages”. Hands on clean up of the existing code with functional techniques, showing improved maintainability, clarity, reusability, and testability.
SECTION ONE – creating the data model from the problem at hand
Estimated Length: 25 minutes
Building an understandable data model right away from the problem using software design principles comes in handy in this section. We understand the problem the look at the possible means to solve it. In this case we are looking at increased deaths due to inadequate blood chain supply and it being hard to find a much donor to save lives.

SECTION TWO – Making the MEAN application functional

Estimated Length: 13 minutes

A discussion of what functional programming principles are, why they are beneficial, and how they’re not relegated to “functional languages”. Hands on clean up of the existing code with functional techniques, showing improved maintainability, clarity, reusability, and testability.


VOLUME THREE – NODE-JS REST APIS WITH EXPRESS-JS

In this section, we will show how to design a RESTful APIs from the NodeJs backend server using the power of ExpressJs. With this in place, AngularJs will be able to make AJAX calls through HTTP in quest for data that will be processed in a possible minimum time and served back in a shortest possible period. Using Advance rest client on Chrome, we shall test out this APIs manually. Just before doing the Mocha test the the same APIs.

SECTION ONE - Talking to the Outside World
Estimated Length: 12 minutes

In this section, we will show how to load data into AngularJs over AJAX. We will also discuss best practices for when to load this data, and which components should own each datum.

VOLUME FOUR – BUILDING AN ANGULARJS CLIENT

In this section, we will show how to build angular, the composition of the Angular app, load data into Angular over AJAX. We will also discuss best practices for when to load this data, and which components should own each datum. We do away with the use of mock data, and actually store information in a database since our backend is ready. we will describe why you would want to do this, why AngularJs handles real-time well, and get some real-time features running on our app and will discuss best practices, troubleshooting, and common gotchas for JS, AngularJs, Express, MongoDB.

SECTION ONE - Talking to the serve system

Estimated Length: 44 minutes

In this section, we will show how to load data into AngularJs over AJAX. We will also discuss best practices for when to load this data, and which components should own each datum.


VOLUME FIVE – BUILDING AN ASYNCHRONUS CLIENT-SERVER MODULE
In this section, we will show how to build a real time communication between the AngularJs and the NodeJs server in real-time. This is a very important aspect when it comes to things like instant notifications of changes made by another user at the same time.
SECTION ONE - Persisting Data with MongoDB and Reacting in Real-Time with Socket.IO
Estimated Length: 8 minutes
