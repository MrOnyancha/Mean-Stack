# Mean-Stack
 • MEAN Stack is very simple compared to other frameworks, and very easy to get up and running. MEAN stack is easy to understand, data flow is clear, and it’s very fast. • MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. • There are not many video courses that I am aware of that show how to do a production-grade application with MEAN with common libraries to make life easier. The focus on functional programming concepts. MEAN is composed of of MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs, and Node.js. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.
